## What’s the difference between a framework and a library?

The key difference between a library and a framework is "Inversion of Control". When you call a method from a library, you are in control. But with a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls you

### Rendering :

the render() method is the only required method in a class component, and is responsible for describing the view to be rendered to the browser window


### Templates:

 is a chunk of HTML that you need to inject onto the page. Often templates are created “server side” – in that they come to the JavaScript fully formed and just need to be put into the DOM

What is JSX ?

-JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is  recommend to use it with React to describe what the UI should look like. 

-most people find using JSX helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.

-This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions.

-Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.

React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes.

React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.
