# Review, Research, and Discussion


### Why is the Context API useful?

-Because it is a way to enable components to share some data without explicitly passing via each component manually.


### Can a component outside of a provider get its context?

-You would first need to wrap some outer component with the SampleProvider HOC. Then by using one or more of the utility functions, you can gain access to the state


### What are some common use cases for using the Context API?

-most important one is to not use the props drilling all the wad down to the components.


### Describe “Context Hell”

-it is same as wrapper hell when your applications have a massive quantity of nested Components, they will cause.

# Document the following Vocabulary Terms

### global state : 

It is only a way to pass props from a parent component to grandchild components without having to pass the props through all child components.


### global context :

Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components.

### What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?

Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.


Some of the designations in an RBAC tool can include:

-Management role scope – it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage.
-Management role group – you can add and remove members.
-Management role – these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group.
-Management role assignment – this links a role to a role group.


BENEFITS OF RBAC ?

-Reducing administrative work and IT support.

-Maximizing operational efficiency. 

-Improving compliance.
