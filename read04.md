# Why would a developer choose to make data models?

The model highlights the chosen terms so that they can be driven forward into software artifacts. The resulting software becomes easier to maintain and extend

# What purpose do CRUD operations serve?

In computer programming, create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) are the four basic functions of persistent storage. Alternate words are sometimes used when defining the four basic functions of CRUD, such as retrieve instead of read, modify instead of update, or destroy instead of delete

# What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB? 

Postgress is a SQL , MongoDB is a No-SQL

# What is Mongoose and why do we need it?

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node. js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

# Definitions :

database: is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system

data model: data model (or datamodel) is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another 

CRUD: (CRUD) are the four basic functions of persistent storage.

schema:refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed (divided into database tables in the case of relational databases). 

sanitize:sanitize-html is tolerant. It is well suited for cleaning up HTML fragments such as those created by CKEditor and other rich text editors. It is especially handy for removing unwanted CSS when copying and pasting from Word.

Structured Query Language (SQL): lets you access and manipulate databases Â·

Non SQL (NoSQL):databases are databases that store data in a format other than relational tables.

MongoDB:is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need.

Mongoose: provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation.

record: lets you create a new type from a Union. The values in the Union are used as attributes of the new type.

document:A Document object represents the HTML document that is displayed in that window. The Document object has various properties that refer to other objects .

Object Relation Mapping (ORM):is the technique of accessing a relational database using an object-oriented programming language.
