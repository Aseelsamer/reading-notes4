## What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
The main difference between the PUT and PATCH method is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource.


## Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server>

## Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
404 & 400 .

## Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST?
-SOAP is a standardized protocol that sends messages using other protocols such as HTTP and SMTP. 
-REST was created to address the problems of SOAP. Therefore it has a more flexible architecture. It consists of only loose guidelines and lets developers implement the recommendations in their own way.

--------------------------


## Term-->

SOAP : is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks.

ReST Verbs:specify an action to be performed on a specific resource or a collection of resources.

CRUD Verbs: PUT , POST , DELETE 7 GET .

Swagger:Swagger allows you to describe the structure of your APIs so that machines can read them. The ability of APIs to describe their own structure is the root of all awesomeness in Swagger.
