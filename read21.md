# Review, Research, and Discussion

### Does a deployed React application require a server?

-You don't necessarily need a static server in order to run a Create React App project in production. It also works well when integrated into an existing server side app.

### Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?

-React Testing Library is a set of helpers that let you test React components without relying on their implementation details. This approach makes refactoring a breeze and also nudges you towards best practices for accessibility.
