## Why is authentication important?
 is important because it enables organizations to keep their networks secure by permitting only authenticated users (or processes) to access its protected resources, which may include computer systems, networks, databases, websites and other network-based applications or services.

## Why should we be careful about storing a user’s password?
websites that do store the user’s passwords in plaintext without any kind of encryption.

## What is the difference between hashing and encryption?
Encryption is a two-way function; what is encrypted can be decrypted with the proper key. Hashing, however, is a one-way function that scrambles plain text to produce a unique message digest. With a properly designed algorithm, there is no way to reverse the hashing process to reveal the original password.

## What is the difference between encryption and encoding?
Encoding is for maintaining data usability and can be reversed by employing the same algorithm that encoded the content, i.e. no key is used. Encryption is for maintaining data confidentiality and requires the use of a key (kept secret) in order to return to plaintext.

## What is a token used for?
A token is used to make security decisions and to store tamper-proof information about some system entity

# Term
authentication :Authentication is the process of recognizing a user’s identity. It is the mechanism of associating an incoming request with a set of identifying credentials.

authorization :Authorization is a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer programs, data and application features.

encryption :Encryption is a way of scrambling data so that only authorized parties can understand the information.

hashing: Hashing is the process of converting a given key into another value. A hash function is used to generate the new value according to a mathematical algorithm.

session:a session is a temporary and interactive information interchange between two or more communicating devices, or between a computer and user.

cookie :is a small piece of data stored on the user's computer by the web browser while browsing a website.

token: Input elements other than white space and comments form the terminal symbols for the syntactic grammar for ECMAScript and are called ECMAScript tokens.

Basic Auth : a mechanism in which the server challenges anyone requesting for information and get a response in the form of a username and password.

encoding :is a way to convert a character that can be displayed on the screen into a binary representation so that it can be stored in memory or transferred over a network.

cryptography :is a growing collection of standard and secure cryptographic algorithms implemented in JavaScript using best practices and patterns.
