## Write the following steps in the correct order:
Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
Receive access token
Receive authorization code
Make a request to the access token endpoint
Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint

## What can you do with an authorization code?

is an alphanumeric password that authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space

## What can you do with an access token?  

is an opaque string that identifies a user, app, or Page and can be used by the app to make graph API calls. When someone connects with an app using Facebook Login and approves the request for permissions, the app obtains an access token that provides temporary, secure access to Facebook APIs

## Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

It allows you to read data of a user from another application. It supplies the authorization workflow for web, desktop applications, and mobile devices. Is a server side web app that uses authorization code and does not interact with user credentials.
