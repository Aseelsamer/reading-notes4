## Hash
 - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
## Buckets
 - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
## Collisions 
- A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

-Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.

## Bucket Sizes
Hash Maps can have any number of buckets. If a hash map has only a few buckets it will be densely full and have many collisions. If a hash map has more buckets it will be more sparsely populated, there will be less collisions, but there may be a lot of extra empty space.

## Hash function
A hash function is any function that can be used to map a data set of an arbitrary size to a data set of a fixed size, which falls into the hash table. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes.

The hash function will compute the same index for all the strings and the strings will be stored in the hash table in the following format. As the index of all the strings is the same, you can create a list on that index and insert all the strings in that list.

## Hash table
A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array in which an element will be inserted or searched. By using a good hash function, hashing can work well. Under reasonable assumptions, the average time required to search for an element in a hash table is O(1).

Separate chaining is one of the most commonly used collision resolution techniques. It is usually implemented using linked lists. In separate chaining, each element of the hash table is a linked list. To store an element in the hash table you must insert it into a specific linked list. If there is any collision (i.e. two different elements have same hash value) then store both the elements in the same linked list.
